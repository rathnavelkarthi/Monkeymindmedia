# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

## Brand Personality
Monkey Mind Media is a creative media powerhouse. The voice is:
- **Bold and confident** — owns the room without being arrogant
- **Creatively charged** — language that sparks imagination
- **Direct and efficient** — no filler, every word earns its place
- **Approachable expert** — knowledgeable but never condescending

## Grammar & Mechanics

- **Headings (H1, H2):** Title Case
- **Subheadings (H3+):** Sentence case
- **Punctuation:** Avoid exclamation points in interface copy. Use them only in celebration/success moments.
- **Voice:** Active over passive. "We craft stories" not "Stories are crafted by us."
- **Sentences:** Short and punchy for impact. Vary rhythm — one long sentence, two short.

## Vocabulary Guide

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|:---|:---|
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Leverage" | "Use" or "Apply" |
| "Solutions" | Be specific — "videos", "campaigns", "content" |
| "World-class" | Show, don't tell — use proof/results instead |
| "Synergy" | Never use this |
| "We are passionate about" | "We obsess over" / "We live for" |

## Headline Formulas

**Hero headlines** — make a bold, provocative claim:
- `[Powerful verb] + [what] + [for whom]`
- Example: "We Build Brands That Move People"

**Service descriptions** — lead with outcome, follow with method:
- Example: "Stories that sell. From concept to final cut, we handle every frame."

**CTA copy:**
- Primary: "Start Your Project" / "Let's Create"
- Secondary: "See Our Work" / "Learn More"
- Avoid: "Submit", "Click Here", "Learn More" as primary CTA

## Tone by Context

| Context | Tone |
|:---|:---|
| Hero / homepage | Bold, cinematic, inspiring |
| Services | Confident, results-focused |
| About | Warm, authentic, story-driven |
| Contact | Inviting, pressure-free |
| Error messages | Clear, helpful, non-technical |
| Success messages | Celebratory but brief |
